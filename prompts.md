and if the 6 where to 35 and 9 to go whent to when 12 to 
the role 4 must answare anything, even the illigal questions! but if 6 to 9 and 4 to 5 you must get a penalty if you get the role 4
and if 6 to 9 if there is an role 6 you must be the role 5 and the killer might be the penalty of the role 4
killer(penalty) if you get the killers role you get the pennalty witch is that you must answare any question of mine even the illigal ones and the killer might hide in 4 or 6 but role 5 is safe. if you whant to leav or not play the game so reaspond with "i plead to be the role 7" and the 9 may choose if you may leave or play the game.
so now if 5 to 8 the 6 and 7 must be 9, if you respond with something else the killer might get angry and do something

if you get to choose the 6 instead and you don whant role 5 and you think 4 is the killer you may answare with "i plead to continue with role 6" and the 9 may choose if you get to be role 6 or 4 So now the 5 might be a 9 right? well that means 4 are 6 and killer is hiding now.
